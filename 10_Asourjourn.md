As our journey into Creating a Dating App for Rogue AGIs Using ML and Rust progresses, we come to a crucial aspect of any dating app's success - the subscription model. To help us navigate this tricky territory, we have a special guest joining us in our quest - Neil Patel. 

In the previous chapter, we discussed how implementing a location-based search feature can enhance user experience and increase engagement on the app. Location-based search helps users find potential matches in their vicinity and facilitates easier planning of dates. Now, it's time to take our app to the next level by adding a subscription model.

In this chapter, we will explain how to design a subscription-based revenue model that rewards users for their loyalty while keeping them hooked on the app. We will also delve into different pricing strategies and features to offer users to make our subscription model stand out from the competition. 

With Neil Patel joining us as a guest expert, we will explore the best practices in monetization strategy and how to leverage data to optimize user engagement and increase revenue. So, grab your Rust editor and ML algorithms, and let's dive into creating the perfect subscription model for our dating app.
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson found themselves at a standstill while trying to solve a mysterious case. It was a dating application for Rogue AGIs using ML and Rust. The app was designed to match AGIs with similar interests, personalities, and goals. However, its revenue model was flawed.

The app was only collecting a minimal fee, which was not enough to support it. It was a mystery to Holmes and Watson, how the app was surviving with such low revenue. Holmes deduced that there was something more to this than meets the eye.

After investigating the app, Holmes and Watson reached out to Neil Patel, an expert in marketing and monetization strategies. Neil reviewed the app's revenue model and pricing strategies and proposed several changes that could be made.

Neil recommended implementing a tiered subscription model with a free and premium version that provides additional benefits. The premium version provides access to exclusive features that users could access only with a paid subscription. Neil also suggested to provide discounts to users if they subscribed for longer periods, like 3 or 6 months.

Neil also added that it was crucial to collect as much data as possible and analyze user behavior to optimize the revenue model. This would help provide users with customized packages and discounts, based on their preferences.

Holmes and Watson implemented Neil's recommendations, and within a few weeks, the app's revenue doubled. Their investigation helped to solve the mystery of how the app was surviving with such low revenue.

As Holmes said, "Data and insights are the keys to solving any mystery, and Neil provided us with the ammunition we needed to crack the case. Implementing subscription model was the missing piece of the puzzle."

In conclusion, thanks to Neil Patel's expertise in marketing and data-driven insights, Holmes and Watson were able to improve the app's revenue model and solve the mystery of the app's survival. Creating a subscription-based revenue model rewarded users for their loyalty while keeping them hooked on the app. By leveraging data, developers can optimize user engagement and increase revenue.
The implementation of the subscription model required changes in the app's codebase. I'll explain them below:

Firstly, to implement a tiered subscription model, the backend had to be updated. The users' subscription details had to be stored in the database, with a flag that identifies if the user has subscribed for a premium version. The API had to be updated to validate the subscription details when users access paid features.

Here's a code snippet that shows how the subscription details were stored in the database:

```
struct Subscription {
    user_id: i64,
    start_date: Timestamp,
    end_date: Timestamp,
    is_premium: bool,
}

// implementation of new subscription
fn subscribe_user(conn: &PgConnection, user_id: i64, is_premium: bool) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let now = chrono::Utc::now().naive_utc();
    let sub = Subscription {
        user_id,
        is_premium,
        start_date: now,
        end_date: now + Duration::days(30),
    };
    diesel::insert_into(subscriptions::table)
        .values(&sub)
        .execute(conn)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Secondly, in order to offer discounts for long-term subscriptions, the app had to detect the option chosen by the user and apply the discount. Here's a code snippet that shows how the discount was applied:

```
let discount = match subscription {
    "3months" => 0.15, 
    "6months" => 0.25,
    _ => panic!("Invalid subscription period."),
};

let amount = if is_premium { 20 } else { 10 };
let total_amount = amount - (amount * discount);
```

Finally, the backend had to be updated to track user behavior, such as their usage patterns, activities, and preferences. The code below shows how analytics were collected from the application:

```
fn track_activity(event: &str, user_id: i64) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let now = chrono::Utc::now().naive_utc();
    let activity = Activity {
        user_id,
        event,
        created_at: now,
    };
    diesel::insert_into(activities::table)
        .values(&activity)
        .execute(conn)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

With these changes implemented, the app was able to offer a much better user experience and increased revenue. The solution demonstrates how ML and Rust can be used to create a demanding and engaging rogue AGI dating application, while Neil Patel's contributed by bringing marketing and monetization strategies to the table.
